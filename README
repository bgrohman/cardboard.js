cardboard.js is a synchronous Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) implementation designed to provide CommonJS module definition features without loading modules asynchronously.

Including cardboard.js will create a global define and require function plus an exports object for use in module definitions. Each of those objects (define, require, and exports) also exist as properties of the global cardboard object.
